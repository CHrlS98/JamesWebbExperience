# The James Webb Experience

**We are team Galaktikus and what you have here is our solution to the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge.**

For the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024, we decided to address the challenge “Symphony of the Stars: Harmonizing the James Webb Space Telescope in Music and Images”. We developed the James Webb Experience, an interactive web application that invites users to explore some of the most iconic observations made by the James Webb Space Telescope. This immersive journey combines breathtaking images from the telescope with captivating music and accessible scientific insights, creating an engaging audio-visual experience designed for a broad audience. Each scene brings the viewers further and further away from the Earth’s surface, up to 13 billion light-years away! Our solution brings the wonders of space exploration to people of all ages and backgrounds, making groundbreaking discoveries both fun and informative.
